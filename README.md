# Queue
### This is a C program that implements a basic menu-driven queue using an array with a fixed size of 10. The program allows the user to perform three operations: enqueue (add an element to the end of the queue), dequeue (remove an element from the front of the queue), and display (print the contents of the queue). The main function runs a loop that displays the menu options and accepts the user's choice. Based on the selected option, the corresponding function is called to perform the requested operation. The enqueue function checks if the queue is full and inserts the element at the end if there is space. The dequeue function removes the element at the front of the queue and returns its value. The display function prints the contents of the queue. The program exits when the user selects the "EXIT" option from the menu.
